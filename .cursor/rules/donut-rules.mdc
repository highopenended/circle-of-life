# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

- I am making a Donut Shop landing page called The Circle of Life

It will use React and Vite and Tailwind

- General layout of the page:
  + Sticky menu at the top
  + Hero Image section
  + About Us Section
  + Menu Section
  + Contact Us Footer

Sticky Menu at Top
- Screenshot 3
- I Want a sticky header at the top with the name of the Shop on the left, then 4 buttons on the right, About, Menu, Contact, Cart
  + Button functionality
    - About will scroll you down to About section
    - Menu will scroll you down to the Menu section
    - Contact will scroll you down to the bottom where there will be social media icons, a phone number, and an email address
    - Cart will just be a placeholder for now
  + I want the buttons to have a faint scroll over effect to give some feedback
  + Slightly transparent

Hero Image Section
- Screenshot 4
- I want a big hero image with the logo in the middle (placeholder for now)
- Just add the spots where the content will go and I'll add it in later, give it some light diagonal stripes to show the section clearly until I can get an image for it

About Us Section
- Screenshot 5
- The About Us section will have a few different images, just make it a big placeholder for now (diagonal stripes again to distinguish its boundaries)

Menu Section
- Screenshot 6
- There is a header at the top that will have the shop logo and the "Menu" text
  + The "Menu" text will be centered, and will have another centered textbox below it that is also centered. These two should be in a wrapper so they stay together.
- The Menu section will have pictures of douts on white backdrops
- I want the spacing of the donuts to all be done with flex, forming a kind of donut grid from the donut cards

Donut Cards
- Each donut card will have the following:
  + Picture of a donut
  + Rough white circular backdrop under the donut image
  + Below the image/white circle is three lines of text
    - Japanese name of the donut
    - English name of the donut
    - Price of the donut in yen
- I want it to be very easy to go into the code and add new donuts

Notes
- I added in 4 donut pictures as examples to get you started
- Keep the code very DRY, scalable, readable
- Have ample but concise documentation so we can edit later
